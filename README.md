# Assignment: PathLib and Directory Management

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the solution for an Assignment. The assignment is part of a course that introduces you to managing directories and files using Python. The primary goal of this assignment is to explore the capabilities of the operating system for handling directories and files efficiently. It also provides hands-on experience in working with path variables, writing unit tests, and using temporary directories as essential support for your program development.

## Task Description

The assignment is divided into three tasks, each consisting of multiple subtasks. Here's a brief overview of the assignment:

## Practical Information
The code skeleton is provided, including function names, arguments, and return types.
Download the code skeleton from the provided link and extract it into your homework repository.
Writing tests using pytest. 

## Required Libraries and Modules
To complete the assignment, you'll need the following libraries and modules:

pathlib
pytest
shutil
tempfile
os
numpy
matplotlib
Please note that pathlib, shutil, tempfile, and os are already included in the Python package, while the remaining libraries may need to be locally installed in your environment.

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we used pollution statistics data from Norway. The main tasks involve restructuring the data, organizing it by gas type, and creating plots. The final directory structure after completing the assignment will include:

The key components of the project include:

analytic_tools: A package containing two modules, plotting.py and utilities.py. plotting.py handles data plotting, while utilities.py includes functions for file operations.
tests: A directory containing test scripts (test_utilities.py, test_analyze_pollution_data.py, test_handin.py) for testing your code.
analyze_pollution_data.py: The main script you will develop for restructuring data and generating plots.
pyproject.toml: A configuration file that enables you to use analytic_tools as a package.
README.md (this file): An overview and instructions for the assignment.

## How to run it
run analyze_pollution_data.py in your terminal when you're in the correct directory.
